# osudl
## I'm rewriting this project, it is for me to learn more about python and web stuff

## Features
1. Batch downloads - Get beatmaps from sources (userpages, beatmap packs, mappools, .db/.txt files, google sheets)
2. Post download verification - after imports, db read again to verify map has been imported, collection can be added from (1) to group downloaded maps
3. maybe: Modern Web GUI - dashboard to do score tracking / session planner, osu collection viewer (group maps by tags), preview and rate change maps
